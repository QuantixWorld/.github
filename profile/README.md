# Quantix World
## What is it?
Being passionated about sciences and development, I've started multiples projects and I wanted to have them all under a same name: Quantix.  
Here you'll find many of my projects I'm proud of and chose to give them the Quantix name.

## Projects
### QuantixScript
As a developer, I wanted to create my own programming language so here is QuantixScript. With it I want to make a programming language suited for mathematical operations

### QuantixOs
I'm also currently stuyding how OS works and want to create my own from scratch

### QuantixTune
I can't work properlly without music and I like it being ordered in my playlist and spotify account. But Spotify doesn't provides some useful tools that are achievable through their API. This web app is a toolbox working with Spotify

### QuantixLearn
A web platform to learn things on subjects like music, code, sciences, and more!
